jreplace


Replace the keywords in a word .docx template by the content
of the columns with the same names in a specific row(s) of an excel sheet.

syntax:  py jreplace xlsx docx rownumber1 rownumber2 ...

The  keywords used in the word template must correspond exactly to columns
in the first row of the excel sheet.

The first  sheet in the excel document will be used.


Installation

The code was originally written and tested under python 2.7, and more
recently (October 2019) ported to python 3.  It also
depends on the libraries sys (included by default), python-docx,
and openpyxl. You may need to install lxml manually, required by python-docx,
as I have found on a Windows7 laptop.

1. copy the software to your computer
   -- create a folder, e.g. in your desktop "C:\Users\(username)\Desktop\jreplace",
   where (username) should be replaced by your username
   and copy the files to it
2. install python 3.x
   -- Download to the installer (it maybe .exe or .msi) froma the internet and run it. (python-3*msi) 
   --Add python to your path (Control panel/system/ Advanced options/ enviroment variables/Path/
     Add path/ C:\Python3x
     Add path/ C:\Python3x\Scripts\
     Copy the jreplace.py file to C:\Python3x\Scripts\ (so now it will be in the path)        
    
3. use pip to install lmxl  
   -- open a command prompt terminal (use the start button and search for "cmd")
   -- type: pip install lxml
   -- Jeimyá¹€s note: it doesnt apper directly. Open C:\Python3x\Scripts\pip3.x.exe and then type pip install lxml
4. use pip to install python-docx
   -- make sure you are online
   -- type: pip install python-docx
5. use pip to install openpyxl
   -- make sure you are still online
   -- type: pip install openpyxl

Test

Open a windows command prompt terminal (see step 3 in the installation
instructions above), change directories to where the software and example
files are, and try generating documents with the attached test files

CD C:\Users\(username)\Desktop\jreplace\
jreplace.py proyectos.xlsx  clausula.docx  4

This should replace the keywords present in the template clausula
with the content of the cells under the same header in the 4th row
of the data  base proyectos.xlsx, creating anew document clausula_0004.docx

Try generating multiple documents at once, for example

jreplace.py proyectos.xlsx clausula.docx 5 2 7 14

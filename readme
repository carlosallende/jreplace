jreplace


Replace the keywords in a word .docx template by the content
of the columns with the same names in a specific row(s) of an excel sheet.

syntax:  py jreplace xlsx docx rownumber1 rownumber2 ...

The  keywords used in the word template must correspond exactly to columns
in the first row of the excel sheet.

The first  sheet in the excel document will be used.


Installation

The code has been tested in python 2.7, which is required. It also
depends on the libraries sys (included by default), python-docx,
and openpyxl. You may need to install lxml manually, required by python-docx,
as I have found on my Windows7 laptop.

1. copy the software to your computer
   -- create a folder, e.g. in your desktop "C:\Users\(username)\Desktop\jreplace",
   where (username) should be replaced by your username
   and copy the files to it
2. install python 2.7
   -- just click on the attached python-2.7.12 exe (python-2.7.12.msi) file. There is an option to add python to your path
   which you will need to switch on when installing.
3. use pip to install lmxl  
   -- open a command prompt terminal (use the start button and search for "cmd")
   -- change directory to where jreplace and lxml-3.6.4.-cp27m-win32.whl
      are, using the command "cd" followed by the directory location.
      If you adopted the folder recommended in step 1 above this will be:
      cd c:\Users\(username)\Desktop\jreplace
   -- type: py -m pip install lxml-3.6.4.-cp27m-win32.whl
4. install python-docx
   -- make sure you are online
   -- type: py -m pip install python-docx
5. install openpyxl
   -- make sure you are still online
   -- type: py -m pip install openpyxl

Test

Open a windows command prompt terminal (see step 3 in the installation
instructions above), change directories to where the software and example
files are, and try generating documents with the attached test files

CD C:\Users\(username)\Desktop\jreplace\
py jreplace proyectos.xlsx  clausula.docx  4

This should replace the keywords present in the template clausula
with the content of the cells under the same header in the 4th row
of the data  base proyectos.xlsx, creating anew document clausula_0004.docx

Try generating multiple documents at once, for example

py jreplace proyectos.xlsx clausula.docx 5 2 7 14
